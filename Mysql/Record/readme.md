## üìö Exercise Structure

### üìù Exercise 1: Database Schema Creation  
**File:** [Q1.SQL](./Q1.SQL)  
**Objectives:**
- Create a database named `employee`
- Design and implement three relational tables:
  - `Employee` (empno, ename, job, managerid, hiredate, salary, commission, deptno)
  - `Department` (deptno, deptname, location)
  - `SalaryGrade` (grade, lowsalary, highsalary)
- Verify table structures using DESCRIBE commands

- Implement 20 essential SQL queries including:
  - Basic SELECT operations with various conditions
  - BETWEEN and IN operators
  - LIKE pattern matching
  - Date-based queries
  - Mathematical operations and column aliases
  - GROUP BY with aggregate functions (COUNT, MIN, MAX, AVG)
  - Sorting results with ORDER BY

### üìù Exercise 5: MongoDB Operations  
**File:** [Q5.JS](./Q5.JS)  
**Objectives:**
- Create an `Inventory` database
- Design a `Products` collection with complex documents containing:
  - Nested specifications documents
  - Arrays for color options and storage capacities
  - Various data types including dates
- Implement 19 MongoDB queries including:
  - Basic document retrieval
  - Field projection
  - Array queries (`$in`, `$nin`, `$elemMatch`)
  - Nested document queries
  - Comparison operators (`$lt`, `$gt`)
  - Logical operators (`$or`, `$and`)
  - Date-based queries
